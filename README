--- HOW TO USE ---
    Running the randomizer:
        Windows users may use the executable file, "mighty_power.exe". Other users, please run "randomizer.py" using Python version 3.8+.

    Compatible with the following roms for Nintendo Gameboy:
        FFL2_NA     2bb0df1b672253aaa5f9caf9aab78224
        SAGA2_JP    10c1170d5b5416a217eb66821060421d

    This randomizer has the following flags:
        e  Randomize monster evolutions.
        f  Randomize enemy formations.
        i  Randomize item and equipment stats.
        k  Randomize monster skills and attributes.
        m  Randomize monster and enemy stats.
        s  Randomize shops.
        t  Randomize treasure chests.
        u  Randomize mutant skills.
        v  Randomize nothing.

    NOTE: Initial attributes for your main party are included in the 'k' flag.

    Additionally, the level of randomness can be adjusted to your preference. A value of 0 changes virtually nothing, a value of 1 is extremely unbalanced (i.e., BabyWyrm can have final boss stats), and 0.5 is the recommended, default setting.

--- REFERENCES ---
    This game was already thoroughly documented before I got around to it. There's a spreadsheet going around containing a great deal of useful information; you can find one version of it at http://www.geocities.ws/kattdood/ffl2/ffl2.htm . There were a lot of things I had to suss out on my own, of course, but access to this data allowed me to create a more fully featured randomizer, so now I pass it on to you.
